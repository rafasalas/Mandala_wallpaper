An Android live wallpaper

After several experiments with the Android version of Processing, I was not completely satisfied with the result.
I decided to explore the native programming in this environment, and its graphics capabilities.

The initial idea was transformed into a somewhat more ambitious project: the creation of an animated wallpaper,
which had some interactivity through touch screen and accelerometers, in addition to certain behavior.

After saving the initial learning curve, plus some additional problems (such as lack of a library of vectors, which was supplied 
with the use of PVector from Processing. It works surprisingly well in Android), development took less time than I expected.

The result has been a curious creature, with a simple but pleasant visual presence, and with a behavior complex enough to be interesting.
